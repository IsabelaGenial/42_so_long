## Overview

Welcome to my 2D project. It's been a challenging journey for me, especially since I'm not familiar with games. Currently, the project includes basic walking and collecting mechanics, and my plan is to add animations and damage/collision mechanics in the future. For the graphics, I used the [MinilibX library](url:https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux ) , developed internally by Escola 42.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you'll need the following:

-   MiniLibX library installed
-   A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
-   Linux or macOS operating system

## Getting Started

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    
    bash
    

-   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/2d-game.git` 
    
-   Compile the game using your C compiler. For example:
    
    bash
    
-   `make` 
    
-   Run the game:
    
    bash
    

1.  `./game maps/file_name.ber` 
    
2.  Enjoy playing!
    

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys and WASD on your keyboard to move your character. 
- Press ESC to exit the game.
